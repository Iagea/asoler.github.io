## üõ† Skills  

I try my best to be a better scientist and a better person every day. Therefore, I took several courses on improving my transferable skills. Such courses allowed me to collaborate with the National Technical Library ([NTK](https://www.techlib.cz/en/)) in several ocasions. Nowadays, I am part of the Expert Council of the National Centre for Information Support of Research, Development, and Innovation (NCIP) where we focus on the development of transferable skills for early career researchers.
