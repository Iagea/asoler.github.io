A Spanish girl exploring the world since 1993. I completed my BS in Biotechnology in an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms of life, my M.Sc. in Bioinformatics after falling in love with it, and nowadays I am a PhD student in the field of Drug Design at the University of Chemistry and Technology in the amazing city of Prague. Passionate about science, puzzles, travelling, sports and beer.
